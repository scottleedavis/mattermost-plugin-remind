### Building 

#### Requirements
* [Go 1.12](https://golang.org/)
* [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)

```
make
```

This will produce a single plugin file (with support for multiple architectures) for upload to your Mattermost server:

```
dist/com.github.scottleedavis.mattermost-plugin-remind.tar.gz
```

There is a build target to automate deploying and enabling the plugin to your server, but it requires configuration as below:
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
make deploy
```
In production, deploy and upload your plugin via the [System Console](https://about.mattermost.com/default-plugin-uploads).
